# KuroTools
Tools for working with Kuro no Kiseki .dat, .mdl and .tbl files. Also works on games released post-Kuro that use the same engine.
DON'T USE THE VERSION IN THE RELEASES SECTION THAT ONE IS FROM 2023 DOWNLOAD THE CODE UNDER THE 'CODE' BUTTON AT THE TOP!

# Compatibility
KuroTools is currently compatible with:

If the file is encrypted (CLE encryption):
- zstandard package is required

# Rundown of Main files
- dat2py.py: Extracts scena files (.dat) intto .py for editing and can be used to recompile back into .dat post editing.
- tbl2json.py: Extracts table files (.tbl) into .json for editing.
- json2tbl.py: Compiles .json files into .tbl which can be loaded by Kuro no Kiseki.
- kuro2compresses.py: Compresses files to be loaded into Kuro no Kiseki 2 -CRIMSON SiN-
- kuro2encrypter.py: Encrypts files to be loaded into Kuro no Kiseki 2 -CRIMSON SiN-
- mdl folder: source code of the MDL exporter/importer

# Guide
Please see the following documents, which include a tutorial to make a simple mod using TBL and scripts editing, as well as a guide to Kuro model injection.

[Guide for TBL & Scena editing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ajbTZzda54i5xZWDLXOq0oOVQrhJYXU9rmgz3Ya3Bc/edit?usp=sharing)  
[Guide for model injection](https://github.com/Trails-Research-Group/Doc/wiki/How-to:-Import-custom-models-to-Kuro-no-Kiseki)

It's advised you use the disassemble mode for scena editing, as it will round trip perfectly (Decompilation might not round trip perfectly for some files, resulting in unreachable code. If that happens it may or may not cause issue after recompilation). To use the diassembler, just add --decompile False to the command.

With the advent of Ys X, some .dat files are known to throw a 'cannot convert float to int' error, resulting in an incomplete .py file being rendered. In the case of such an error being encountered while modding, please switch to disassemble mode as outlined in the previous paragraph and run dat2py again on the .dat file.

See [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_nECCpRQJacN2i3g4gAVZtsiHF1Bg2XzVwrp7oOGl8/edit?usp=sharing) to learn how to add your own schemas to the tool.  
And [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ofetrdRn3BY8GIqfnzWrutw9MnyNEfLYZ6NOgxZzg8A/edit) can help you script the AIs (to create your custom battles).    
  
For Kuro 2, The textures and models will require compression, and the dat and tbl files will require compression+encryption (Remember: Its always compression first, encryption second) 

If 2 games have different schemas with identical length it may be wise to use a "-g" argument when decompiling. Example:

PS D:\Translation\Sora1\tool\KuroTools-master> python tbl2json.py t_books.tbl
{'name': 'BooksTitle', 'length': 24, 'count': 33, 'start': 248, 'schema': 'Sora1'}
{'name': 'BooksText', 'length': 24, 'count': 184, 'start': 1040, 'schema': 'Kuro2'}
{'name': 'BooksCategory', 'length': 24, 'count': 3, 'start': 5456, 'schema': 'Sora1'}

PS D:\Translation\Sora1\tool\KuroTools-master> python tbl2json.py -g Sora1 t_books.tbl
{'name': 'BooksTitle', 'length': 24, 'count': 33, 'start': 248, 'schema': 'Sora1'}
{'name': 'BooksText', 'length': 24, 'count': 184, 'start': 1040, 'schema': 'Sora1'}
{'name': 'BooksCategory', 'length': 24, 'count': 3, 'start': 5456, 'schema': 'Sora1'}

As you can see the BooksText schema being used has been changed from Kuro2 to Sora1 in this case.

# MDL extraction/import
<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69110695/185493665-86b7cf3f-23a2-40e7-84d2-cb868ba66348.gif"/></p>

From version 1.2.0, we introduce a new tool for asset extraction for Kuro 1 ONLY. 

To use the tool, either drag and drop a mdl on ED9AssetExporter.exe, or put the base mdl (ex: chr0000.mdl) together with their animations (ex : chr0000_mot_ev_ride_bike_wait.mdl) in the same folder, then drop that folder on ED9AssetExporter.exe (it will hopefully add the animations to the base model).

The tool outputs a single fbx file.
Textures are not included in the mdl so you have to retrieve them from the game files and put them in the same folder than the output fbx before opening it in blender or whichever 3D tool you are using.

As of version 1.3, the tool also supports model injection (MDL creation from FBX file) for Kuro 1 ONLY. See the guide above on how to do it.

# Alternative tools
## Scena editing
The script disassembler is very rough and not very userfriendly, more like a prototype type of thing made from the study of PS4 eboot. If you find it too difficult, please have a look at other alternatives to decompile the script files:
- [Ouroboros' ED9Decompiler](https://github.com/Ouroboros/Falcom/tree/master/Decompiler2/Falcom/ED9) 
- [Xxmyl Kuro Modify Tool](https://github.com/Xxmyl/KuroModifyTool/tree/v0.5-beta/KuroModifyTool)
## MDL export
- [(Python) uyjulian's asset extractor](https://gist.github.com/uyjulian/9a9d6395682dac55d113b503b1172009)  
- [(Python) eArmada8's extract and import MDL tool](https://github.com/eArmada8/kuro_mdl_tool)
